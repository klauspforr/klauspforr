# Hi

I am a sociologist working at GESIS, specifically on EU-SILC in the German Microdata Lab (GML).
 
My research interests are econometrics, survey methodology, sociology of wealth, family sociology, integration/migration, ethnic segregation, interested in social inequality, with a special focus on wealth inequality.
